## Detailed Instructions

First, you take the dinglepop, and you smooth it out with a bunch of schleem. The schleem is then repurposed for later batches.

Then you take the dinglebop and push it through the grumbo, where the fleeb is rubbed against it. It's important that the fleeb is rubbed, because the fleeb has all of the fleeb juice.

Then a Shlami shows up and he rubs it, and spits on it.

Then you cut the fleeb. There's several hizzards in the way.

The blaffs rub against the chumbles, and the plubus and grumbo are shaved away.

That leaves you with a regular old plumbus!
